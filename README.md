# ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Rahul*
- I am an experienced cross-platform mobile application developer. I have been involved in creating interactive UI and features implementation for large scale applications. I seek out new technologies constantly, and always push myself to learn more.
- Apart from being a web developer, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, playing video games, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.
